# hiredis for PHP7

The hiredis-php extension provides an API for communicating with the 
[Redis](http://redis.io/) key-value store. It is released under the [PHP 
License, version 3.01](http://www.php.net/license/3_01.txt).

It is currently very much work in progress and designed for PHP7 and to be compatible with the [phpredis](https://github.com/phpredis/phpredis) extension.
