# hiredis for PHP7 (ARCHIVED) 

The hiredis-php extension provides an API for communicating with the 
[Redis](http://redis.io/) key-value store. It is released under the [PHP 
License, version 3.01](http://www.php.net/license/3_01.txt).

It is currently very much work in progress and designed for PHP7 and to be compatible with the [phpredis](https://github.com/phpredis/phpredis) extension.

The project was a nice way for me to catch up on php7+ internals, but it is now abandoned. You can find a working alternative [here](https://github.com/rnk/phpredis).
